**Detecting recurrent sources of variability in animal tracking studies** 
Virginia Morera-Pujol et al. submitted to Ecological Applications in 2021 

These functions were developed to detect the effect of these three sources of variability in the distribution of groups of animals when inferred from individual tracking data. These procedures are applicable to any set of tracking data regardless of the species or tracking technique.
