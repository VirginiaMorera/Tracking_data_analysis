Functions and code from the paper 

**Methods to detect spatial biases in tracking studies caused by differential representativeness of individuals, populations and time** 
Virginia Morera-Pujol et al. 2022, Diversity and Distributions. (DOI: 10.1111/ddi13642)  

These functions were developed to detect the effect of these three sources of variability in the distribution of groups of animals when inferred from individual tracking data. These procedures are applicable to any set of tracking data regardless of the species or tracking technique.
